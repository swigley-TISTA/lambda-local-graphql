# AWS Lambda Local API Development

A node.js example showing how to develop a GraphQL API locally for AWS Lambda and deploy with terraform.  Inspired by the AWS documentation [Step-through debugging Node.js functions locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging-nodejs.html), but using Terraform for infrastructure configuration and deployment.

1. Install [AWS SAM CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).

To build, run npm run-script build.

```
> npm run-script build
